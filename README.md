# Automatic-Solar-Tracker-System
- Designed and Manufactured a Prototype of a Automatic Solar Tracker System.It traces the Path of the Sun
throughout the day and give data of the position of sun according to the observation.This system is implemented
over a Solar Panel in our prototype.This system is used enhance the Energy production by the Solar Panel.
- Arduino Atmega328p is the main microcontroller used in this prototype coded in Arduino IDE using C programming language.LDR(Light Detecting Resistor) is the Sensor And Servo Motor is the main Motor used here. All
the circuit interface is manufactured over a PCB Board
